              Millions of companion animals in shelters
              across America are just waiting for a special home like yours.
              Navigating the adoption process isn't as hard as you think.
              We can help you find the perfect pet and 
              discover how amazing adopting a pet can be.
            </p>
            <p>
              An animal shelter or a rescue group is the best source for a new pet,
              and our pet-care experts have compiled all the
              information you'll need to find your nearest group, 
              select a pet who matches your lifestyle, and more.

          <h2>Volunteer Your Valuable Time</h2>
          <p>
            Say, “Yes, I am here,” to a lonely shelter kitty or puppy.
            We can all use a little scratch behind the ears.
            Donate your time to help the animals! Opportunities include dog walking, 
            puppy and kitty petting, yard sale assistance, fundraising, community
            outreach, and more. Your valuable gift of 
            time will have a positive impact on our community.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of our volunteers are wonderful people just like you. 
            As an advocate for animal welfare you will have many two legged and 
            four legged friends! Say, “Yes, I am here,” and volunteer today.
