            <h2>Finding a Forever Friend</h2>
            <p>
              Millions of companion animals in shelters
              across America are just waiting for a special home like yours.
              Navigating the adoption process isn't as hard as you think.
              We can help you find the perfect pet and 
              discover how amazing adopting a pet can be.
            </p>
            <p>
              An animal shelter or a rescue group is the best source for a new pet,
              and our pet-care experts have compiled all the
              information you'll need to find your nearest group, 
              select a pet who matches your lifestyle, and more.

              puppy and kitty petting, yard sale assistance, fundraising, community
              outreach, and more. Your valuable gift of 
              time will have a positive impact on our community.
